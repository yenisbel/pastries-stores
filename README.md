## 🚀 Quick start

Before steps make sure that is installed Node.js and Gatsby.js

1.  **Start developing.**

    Clone the repo and Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd location/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
